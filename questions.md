Questions we have about React / Frontend development

1. Can we pass backbone models to our React components? Can they only be passed as state? Only as props? Which one is supposed to be immutable again? See [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21709905/can-i-avoid-forceupdate-when-using-react-with-backbone)
2. What the hell does Webpack do that Browserify doesn\'t? [Webpack compared link](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/webpack_compared/)
3. Why the fuck does React move so fast?
4. React hot loader - what is this? https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate
5. What if reducer needs to hit the server before returning new state?
6. What es isomorphic fetch?
7. Why can't we dispatch in child components
